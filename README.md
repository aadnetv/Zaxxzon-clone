# **Prompt 1: Core Game Design & Mechanics Documentation**

Create comprehensive design documentation for a Zaxxon-inspired game including:

* Detailed explanation of the isometric perspective implementation  
* Specific player ship control mechanics (movement ranges, speed values)  
* Altitude system design with exact parameters  
* Collision detection logic for 3D space within an isometric view  
* Fuel consumption rates and management system  
* Scoring system with point values for all game elements

# **Prompt 2: Visual Design & UI Elements**

Generate the visual components needed for the game:

* SVG designs for the player spacecraft from multiple angles  
* SVG templates for basic obstacles (walls, barriers)  
* SVG designs for enemy units and turrets  
* UI element designs including altitude meter and fuel gauge  
* Color palette reference matching Zaxxon's original aesthetic  
* Simple SVG animations for explosions and weapon fire  
* Grid layout specifications for the isometric environment

# **Prompt 3: Pseudocode & Logic Implementation**

Develop the technical foundation with:

* JavaScript pseudocode for player movement in isometric space  
* Collision detection algorithms accounting for altitude  
* Obstacle generation and scrolling logic  
* Enemy AI behavior patterns in pseudocode  
* Scoring and game state management logic  
* Level progression system with difficulty scaling formulas  
* Boss encounter behavior patterns

# **Prompt 4: HTML/CSS/JavaScript Implementation**

Create a basic web implementation including:

* HTML structure for the game container and UI elements  
* CSS styling for the game interface and visual elements  
* JavaScript code for rendering the isometric grid  
* JavaScript functions for player input handling  
* Basic game loop implementation  
* DOM manipulation for UI updates  
* Simple animation functions for game objects

# **Prompt 5: React Component Structure**

Design a React-based implementation with:

* Component hierarchy for a web-based version  
* Main Game component with state management  
* Player, Enemy, and Obstacle subcomponents  
* UI components for score, fuel, and altitude display  
* Game loop implementation using React hooks  
* Event handling for player inputs  
* Sample implementation of isometric rendering in React
